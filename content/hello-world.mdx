Hi there! 👋

In a recent hackathon, our team, RogersAI, had the incredible opportunity to tackle a real-world challenge: improving disaster response using advanced technology. Our solution focused on using **drones powered by AI** 🛰️ to detect people in post-disaster scenarios, enabling faster and more efficient rescue operations 🚑.

### The Challenge 🌍
Natural disasters often leave vast areas affected, and finding survivors quickly is crucial. We set out to create a solution that leverages **synthetic data** and **machine learning** 🤖 to analyze drone footage in real time, identifying people in areas that are hard to reach by traditional means.

### The Solution 💡
Our system consisted of drones equipped with cameras and an AI model that detects individuals within the captured images. Using **synthetic data** 🖼️, we trained our model to recognize human presence in various disaster scenarios, ensuring accuracy across diverse environments. This was especially important since real-world disaster data is scarce and difficult to collect.

### Why ESG Matters 🌱
Our solution was deeply aligned with **Environmental**, **Social**, **and Governance (ESG)** principles, focusing on the social responsibility of saving lives ❤️. By automating the search process, we can reduce the time it takes to locate survivors, directly impacting communities in need and mitigating the human toll of natural disasters.

### The Impact 🏆
By the end of the hackathon, our efforts paid off as **RogersAI** composed by Ólin Medeiros, Murilo Prianti, Rodrigo Sales, Fernando Vasconcellos and Luiza Rubim was awarded first place! 🥇 This win not only validated our approach but also highlighted the potential for AI and drones in disaster recovery operations. We’re excited to continue exploring how technology can make a real difference in the world 🌍.

This experience reinforced my belief in the power of AI to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, and I’m eager to keep pushing boundaries in this space 🔥.

Stay tuned for more updates on our journey! 🚀
